Lichens are composite organisms consisting of a fungus (the mycobiont) and a
photosynthetic partner (the photobiont or phycobiont) growing together in a
symbiotic relationship. The photobiont is usually either a green alga
(commonly Trebouxia) or cyanobacterium (commonly Nostoc). 

The morphology,
physiology and biochemistry of lichens are very different from those of the
isolated fungus and alga in culture. Lichens occur in some of the most extreme
environments on Earthâ€”arctic tundra, hot deserts, rocky coasts, and toxic slag
heaps. 

However, they are also abundant as epiphytes on leaves and branches in
rain forests and temperate woodland, on bare rock, including walls and
gravestones, and on exposed soil surfaces (e.g., Collema) in otherwise mesic
habitats. 

The roofs of many buildings have lichens growing on them. Lichens
are widespread and may be long-lived; however, many are also vulnerable to
environmental disturbance, and may be useful to scientists in assessing the
effects of [air pollution](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v289/n5795/abs/289289a0.html),
ozone depletion, and metal contamination.

Lichens are informally classified by growth form into:

## Lichens as pollution indicators

Lichens are sensitive to air pollution, specially the air's acidity.
Therefore, the presence or absence can be used to see how clean the air is.
Shrubby and leafy lichens only survive in clean air, and when an area is
really polluted you will not find anyone.

The goal of this application is to help to analyze, classify and measure the
size of the lichens in order to study the quality of air in different areas of
the cities.

Look for lichens on walls, stones and trees take pictures with your phone and
submit the data using this [EpiCollect Plus Lichens
project](http://plus.epicollet.net/lichens). Then, you can help in measuring
the size of the lichen in this web application!

Based on the size of the lichen we will estimate the pollution according to
this table (extracted from an [article](http://www.epa.gov/airnow/workshop_tea
chers/dont_take_a_lichen_for_pollution.pdf) published by the [United States
Enviromental Protection Agency](http://www.epa.gov/)):

 * **100mm - 120mm**: Excellent
 * **70mm - 90mm**: Good 
 * **40mm - 60mm**: Fair
 * **00mm - 30mm** : Poor
