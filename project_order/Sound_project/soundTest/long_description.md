SoundCloud App is a **demo application** for PyBossa that shows how you can
crowdsourcing sound recognition problem.

This application uses the SoundCloud web service as the source of the data. By
using SoundCloud, we have the possibility of using its API to refine the
searches, and looking for specific tags or descriptions that match a specific
criteria, i.e. hip-hop music from the 80's.

In this demo application, we use a very simple approach by loading some sound
clips from SoundCloud.

Based on the answer of the users, we will be able to classify the sound clips,
distributing the tasks (thanks to PyBossa) to different users and volunteers.
