Tagging Pictures is a **demo project** for PyBossa that shows how you can
crowdsourcing an image tagging problem.

This project uses the Flickr web service as the source of the data and the
pictures provided by [Australian War Memorial
collection](http://www.flickr.com/photos/australian-war-
memorial/with/8661409625/). By using Flickr, we have the possibility of using
its API to refine the searches, and looking for specific tags or descriptions
that match a specific criteria, i.e. houses of 1920 or tsunami. In this case
the application shows how you can tag faces of people from old photos in order
to identify them.

This demo project loads a picture from [Australian War Memorial
collection](http://www.flickr.com/photos/australian-war-
memorial/with/8661409625/) and ask the following question: **Tag all the faces
of people that you know**.

Then, the user can click on the picture and drag to draw a square on top of
the face. This action will open a window where the user will be able to type
the name of the person and save it.

Based on the answer of the users, we will be able to classify the photos,
distributing the tasks (thanks to PyBossa) to different users and volunteers.
